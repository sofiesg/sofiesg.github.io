      <h1>About this site</h1>
      <p>
        This site has a playlist to help students focus as they study. The
        playlist has different genres so users can listen to music that better
        suit their individual tastes. The songs are calm and relaxing, suitable for 
        playing in the background as users focus on different tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the music plays, users can look up at their study budy and feel motivated to keep going. 
        Videos are the most efficient at getting and keeping users' attention, but the media can't 
        be too distracting that it disturbs focus. Thats why the site uses a short, lopping gif that 
        doesn't show anything to energetic. It's interesting enough to attract users to the site and 
        shows the site's purpose without doing too much.
