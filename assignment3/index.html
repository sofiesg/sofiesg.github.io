  <!-- This website is a mini art gallery of classic norwegian art pices. Photos of the art will be 
       displayed on "cards" that will be contained in individual slides. They will have an h3 which will 
       inform users of the art piece's theme or message. When hovering over the cards, they will show their 
       own unique effect which will reveal a hidden card containing information on the art piece. 
       The background of the website will also change to an image of the artist(s) behind the art. 
       The info cards will also have a link to external websites with more detailed information about 
       the art pieces so users can learn more with little effort on their part. -->
  <!-- I think the different card:hover effects will make the gallery more interesting and get users 
      more interested in the displayed art, encourage them to hover on all cards, not just the ones 
      that grabs their attention right away. -->

<!-- Challenges  -->
<!-- If this design would be used as an actual gallery, it would be difficut to come up with 
enough unique hover effects. I had a hard time coming up with more effects that would be 
different enough from eachother. This is why I limited myself to only four art pieces. 
One way to work on that could be to instead have cards in sections/own pages where 
the section has an unique card:hover effect so all cards in a section would behave the same. 
ex. same effect for all art by one aritst, or same effect for all art from a specific era 
(all art from the rennaisance would have the same effect)-->
<!-- The card:hover effects would be limited by usability. There needs to enough room for all text 
to show and angling the information cards would make it more tedious and frustrating to read.-->
<!-- An actual gallery/museum would also want the whole picture to be idsplayed. In that case the 
 front-cards could expand to real dimension + size when hovering -->
<!-- Some of the background images would need a different size (shorter) so the transition-->
