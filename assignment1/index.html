        <h2>Week 2 questions</h2>
        <h3>
          1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting
          with the experience?
        </h3>
        <p>
          My attention immediately went to the h2 on the middle of the page. The
          layout is messy with an unclear hierarchy, so my eyes went all over
          the website without knowing what to focus on next.
        </p>
        <h3>
          2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
          your discrete actions.
        </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The first thing I did was move my mouse around the page to see if
            anything would change if I hovered over it.
          </li>
          <li>
            I then scrolled down the page to see if there was anything more than
            videos and if there was some information in the footer of the page.
          </li>
          <li>
            The videos were going very fast and it was tiring to look at so I
            avoided watching them. - I started inspecting the sidebar, there
            were no color changes or other communication to show they were
            interactive
          </li>
          <li>
            The layout reminded me of an advent calendar so tried clicking on
            the boxes to see if they'd open or change in some other way
          </li>
          <li>
            After the first box opened I clicked on every box to see which ones
            opened. Some of the boxes had Christmas themed objects in them. When
            hovering over them they'd shake and my mouse would change into a
            hand.
          </li>
          <li>
            I then grabbed the objects, dragged them around the page and stacked
            them on top of each other
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>
          3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
          with?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The calendar and the “gifts” inside. It was fun to get surprises and I
          didn't expect to be able to take the gifts out of the box and move
          them to every part of the page.
        </p>
        <h3>
          4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
          the experience?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Out of all my actions, I clicked the most. I went back to clicking the
          calendar after moving the gifts to see if anything changed and then on
          other parts of the page to see if there were any other hidden gifts
          there too.
        </p>
        <h3>
          5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
          interactive experience?
        </h3>
        <p>
          To show the website creator's skills and abilities through their
          previous projects. It brings special attention to the creator's
          technical skill of gamification elements on websites as well as their
          creativity in their design. The end goal is that this website will
          interest potential clients and give the creator new contract work.
        </p>
        <h3>
          6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            By showing the website's function in a video on the right and having
            an attractive design.
          </li>
          <li>
            The sidebar looking like an advent calendar gets the users'
            attention without any animation and other “loud” communications.
          </li>
          <li>
            The other videos and photos from their previous projects also show
            their skills in other areas and that they can fulfill the work they
            sign on to. Potential clients will get a better sense of their
            abilities and believe it's likely they can trust them as a
            contractor.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
          with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
        </h3>
        <p>
          By exploring the whole page and getting the user more engaged while
          giving them first-hand experience with the creator's skill. This can
          leave a better and longer lasting impression than just looking at
          videos and reading about it. I personally refreshed the site to see if
          anything would be different, like the gifts being hidden elsewhere. I
          think only a minute is needed to get familiar with the site and test
          it out before looking more thoroughly at the other websites in the
          creator's folio. While there are problems with layout, hierarchy and
          too much going on at once – they have made a good choice with grabbing
          users' attention with something fun. I also believe they would want to
          return to the site or show it to someone else.
        </p>
        <h3>
          8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
          interacted with over time?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Once you've opened the first box with a gift you get told by a shaking
          motion and different mouse that there's more to do. Since the first
          video shows the current website, once users are done playing around
          with the sidebar their attention goes to the videos. The “game” makes
          the users more interested in other works by the creator. They are more
          likely to check them out and pay more attention than if the sidebar
          was nothing but a regular navigation menu.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Week 3 questions</h2>
        <h3>
          9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
          reference?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The sidebar design references to advent calendars with the layout,
          “opening” effect and the hidden presents. For those that didn’t grow
          up with the calendars, it can remind them of school lockers. The
          design is familiar enough for users to inspect the sidebar and check
          if the boxes can be opened.
        </p>
        <h3>
          10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
          act when engaging with your research experience?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The calendar sidebar encourages users to actively interact with the
          site instead of passively scroll down and watch the slideshows. Since
          there aren't presents behind every box, users will be more likely to
          keep opening every box. They get to experience what the creator can do
          and will be more interested in the other works in the folio. Possibly
          with a more positive and openminded outlook than before they
          interacted with the calendar.
        </p>
        <h3>
          11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
          feel when engaging with your research experience?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The calendar is almost like a mini game, this gets the users more
          excited and engaged. As mentioned in the previous question, the user
          can quickly go from indifference to a much more positive attitude. I
          believe the users will be more interested and pay much more attention
          to the other works in the creator's folio.
        </p>
        <h3>
          12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and
          what makes that part frustrating?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Lack of proper hierarchy and too much movement that doesn't stop.
          There's too much small text and too little distinction between the
          headings. If the text were bigger it would be more comfortable to read
          and be more accessible to those with weakened sight. Besides the
          videos themselves, the website design is doing a poor job of
          distinguishing it's different parts. It makes it difficult to see what
          belongs together. While the advent calendar is a fun feature I don't
          think it should be in the sidebar. Their contact info is hidden in the
          sidebar with how little it stands out.
        </p>
        <h3>
          13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and
          what makes that part satisfying?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The most satisfying part for me was that there were actual objects
          behind the doors that I could grab and move around. I didn't expect to
          move it around much, but I could drag it to every part of the page.
