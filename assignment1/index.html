          <h2>Week 2 questions</h2>
          <h3>
            1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting
            with the experience?
          </h3>
          <p>
            My attention immediately went to the h2 on the middle of the page.
            The layout is messy with an unclear hierarchy, so my eyes went all
            over the website without knowing what to focus on next.
          </p>
          <h3>
            2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each
            of your discrete actions.
          </h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The first thing I did was move my mouse around the page to see if
              anything would change if I hovered over it.
            </li>
            <li>
              I then scrolled down the page to see if there was anything more
              than videos and if there was some information in the footer of the
              page.
            </li>
            <li>
              The videos were going very fast and it was tiring to look at so I
              avoided watching them. - I started inspecting the sidebar, there
              were no color changes or other communication to show they were
              interactive
            </li>
            <li>
              The layout reminded me of an advent calendar so tried clicking on
              the boxes to see if they'd open or change in some other way
            </li>
            <li>
              After the first box opened I clicked on every box to see which
              ones opened. Some of the boxes had Christmas themed objects in
              them. When hovering over them they'd shake and my mouse would
              change into a hand.
            </li>
            <li>
              I then grabbed the objects, dragged them around the page and
              stacked them on top of each other
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>
            3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
            with?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The calendar and the “gifts” inside. It was fun to get surprises and
            I didn't expect to be able to take the gifts out of the box and move
            them to every part of the page.
          </p>
          <h3>
            4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction
            with the experience?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Out of all my actions, I clicked the most. I went back to clicking
            the calendar after moving the gifts to see if anything changed and
            then on other parts of the page to see if there were any other
            hidden gifts there too.
          </p>
          <h3>
            5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
            interactive experience?
          </h3>
          <p>
            To show the website creator's skills and abilities through their
            previous projects. It brings special attention to the creator's
            technical skill of gamification elements on websites as well as
            their creativity in their design. The end goal is that this website
            will interest potential clients and give the creator new contract
            work.
          </p>
          <h3>
            6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary
            goal?
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              By showing the website's function in a video on the right and
              having an attractive design.
            </li>
            <li>
              The sidebar looking like an advent calendar gets the users'
              attention without any animation and other “loud” communications.
            </li>
            <li>
              The other videos and photos from their previous projects also show
              their skills in other areas and that they can fulfill the work
              they sign on to. Potential clients will get a better sense of
              their abilities and believe it's likely they can trust them as a
              contractor.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>
            7) What is your impression of how the experience should be
            interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different
            times)
          </h3>
          <p>
            By exploring the whole page and getting the user more engaged while
            giving them first-hand experience with the creator's skill. This can
            leave a better and longer lasting impression than just looking at
            videos and reading about it. I personally refreshed the site to see
            if anything would be different, like the gifts being hidden
            elsewhere. I think only a minute is needed to get familiar with the
            site and test it out before looking more thoroughly at the other
            websites in the creator's folio. While there are problems with
            layout, hierarchy and too much going on at once – they have made a
            good choice with grabbing users' attention with something fun. I
            also believe they would want to return to the site or show it to
            someone else.
          </p>
          <h3>
            8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
            interacted with over time?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Once you've opened the first box with a gift you get told by a
            shaking motion and different mouse that there's more to do. Since
            the first video shows the current website, once users are done
            playing around with the sidebar their attention goes to the videos.
            The “game” makes the users more interested in other works by the
            creator. They are more likely to check them out and pay more
            attention than if the sidebar was nothing but a regular navigation
            menu.
          </p>

          <h2>Week 3 questions</h2>
          <h3>
            9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
            reference?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The sidebar design references to advent calendars with the layout,
            “opening” effect and the hidden presents. For those that didn’t grow
            up with the calendars, it can remind them of school lockers. The
            design is familiar enough for users to inspect the sidebar and check
            if the boxes can be opened.
          </p>
          <h3>
            10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you
            should act when engaging with your research experience?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The calendar sidebar encourages users to actively interact with the
            site instead of passively scroll down and watch the slideshows.
            Since there aren't presents behind every box, users will be more
            likely to keep opening every box. They get to experience what the
            creator can do and will be more interested in the other works in the
            folio. Possibly with a more positive and openminded outlook than
            before they interacted with the calendar.
          </p>
          <h3>
            11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you
            should feel when engaging with your research experience?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The calendar is almost like a mini game, this gets the users more
            excited and engaged. As mentioned in the previous question, the user
            can quickly go from indifference to a much more positive attitude. I
            believe the users will be more interested and pay much more
            attention to the other works in the creator's folio.
          </p>
          <h3>
            12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and
            what makes that part frustrating?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Lack of proper hierarchy and too much movement that doesn't stop.
            There's too much small text and too little distinction between the
            headings. If the text were bigger it would be more comfortable to
            read and be more accessible to those with weakened sight. Besides
            the videos themselves, the website design is doing a poor job of
            distinguishing it's different parts. It makes it difficult to see
            what belongs together. While the advent calendar is a fun feature I
            don't think it should be in the sidebar. Their contact info is
            hidden in the sidebar with how little it stands out.
          </p>
          <h3>
            13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and
            what makes that part satisfying?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The most satisfying part for me was that there were actual objects
            behind the doors that I could grab and move around. I didn't expect
            to move it around much, but I could drag it to every part of the
            page.
          </p>
          <h3>Additional comments</h3>
          <p>
            I noticed after shortening the length of my browser that the hidden
            gifts in the advent calendar will suddenly peak out (shown in the
            picture below). I don't have the knowledge and skills to suggest how
            this coudl be fixed, but it would be in the creator's best interest
            to fix it as it can hurt their impression on potential clients.
          </p>
          <img
            src="media/ProblemsA1.png"
            alt="The page's sidebar showing the gifts peaking out from under the boxes after making prowser size smaller"
          />
          <p>
            As for the rest of their page I would suggest changing the layout to
            be less messy and have too much going on at once. The advent
            calendar is a good idea and does a great job of getting the users
            engaged. I think changing the sidebar into a header would be better
            as it wouldn't be so up and close with the slideshows. This would
            also allow the slideshows to be bigger now that theres more
            horizontal space. The creator should also make the text larger for
            readability and make a proper hierarchy where headers are more
            prominent.
